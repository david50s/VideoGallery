00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.160 align:middle line:90%
On a cool spring morning
The Beavertail Lighthouse Beacon

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:20.140 align:middle line:90%
Cuts the morning fog, a job
That has continued for over 250 years.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.470 align:middle line:90%
Built from stone, concrete and steel,
The present day lighthouse stands

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.099 align:middle line:90%
70 feet tall, 100 feet from
The edge of the cliff and

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:38.280 align:middle line:90%
It casts its beam every
Six seconds for 15 miles.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.460 align:middle line:90%
This is in stark contrast
With the original structure built

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.280 align:middle line:90%
In 1749 out of wood and whose
Long forgotten foundation was

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:58.479 align:middle line:90%
Unearthed during the hurricane
Of 1938.

00:00:58.479 --> 00:01:03.979 align:middle line:90%
Despite the advancement of other
Navigational aids including GPS,

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:07.070 align:middle line:90%
There is nothing like the visual
Flash burning through the mist

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.030 align:middle line:90%
To alert mariners of their location
And their proximity to the reefs

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.750 align:middle line:90%
And entrance to Narragansett Bay.
Richard Chellis was 2 years old

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.120 align:middle line:90%
When his father Carl S. Cehellis
Was the keeper of the Beavertail Light

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:26.330 align:middle line:90%
From 1938 until 1946.
He lived there with his parents

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.690 align:middle line:90%
And he has memories of
His father's duties keeping the Beavertail

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:31.910 align:middle line:90%
Lighthouse.
I remember going up the

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:36.530 align:middle line:90%
Stairs of thre Lighthouse when I was about
2 years old and I remember

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:43.430 align:middle line:90%
that Fresnel lens was a very
Polished and a very pristine condition.

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:48.540 align:middle line:90%
Being a Lighthousekeeper meant
That you had to maintain the

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.840 align:middle line:90%
Property, you had to keep
The light in working condition.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.170 align:middle line:90%
As I remember my mother saying
When I was growing up recalling

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:03.920 align:middle line:90%
Those years that inspectors would
Periodically show up unannounced

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.950 align:middle line:90%
To see how everything was maintained
And what kind of condition

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.379 align:middle line:90%
Things were in.
So needless o say you had

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:21.400 align:middle line:90%
To maintain the light at all times you know.
Basically it was a 24 hour a day job,

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.310 align:middle line:90%
365 days a year you know.
I mean navigation was essential

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.620 align:middle line:90%
For that.
Life was not as difficult

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.650 align:middle line:90%
On the Beavertail Lighthouse
Which was built on land

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.450 align:middle line:90%
As it was on scores of
Other ligfhthouses that were built

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.140 align:middle line:90%
On outposts at sea.
These homes needed supplies

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.060 align:middle line:90%
And maintenance which was
Furnished by an early branch

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.160 align:middle line:90%
of the Coast Guard
Called the Lighthouse Service.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.600 align:middle line:90%
Robert Dennis worked aboard the
Lighthouse tender "Shrub".

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.120 align:middle line:90%
Shrub's duties included attending
and supplying

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.700 align:middle line:90%
The lighthouses not accessible
By land and the sometimes

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.069 align:middle line:90%
Treacherous job of maintaining
The buoys and navigational

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:04.100 align:middle line:90%
Aids up and down the
New England Coast.

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:11.780 align:middle line:90%
The winter of '39 we
Had alot of ice, the bay was frozen

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.959 align:middle line:90%
Way down below Prudence Island.
Every time the tide went out,

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:21.280 align:middle line:90%
The ice would pull these
Navigational aids under the ice,

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.990 align:middle line:90%
Put the lamp out and
The buoy would come back up

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:27.470 align:middle line:90%
And it's out, so we had to
Go out to the buoy,

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.230 align:middle line:90%
Jump on it, and it was
All covered with ice,

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.290 align:middle line:90%
Jump on it, open the lantern
Bale out all the salt water,

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:40.989 align:middle line:90%
Get it dry,light it again
With a match. So that's all

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:46.870 align:middle line:90%
It was a lean torch.
And close it up. The next day

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.670 align:middle line:90%
We came out and do it again.
Ice would just sink it,

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:51.930 align:middle line:90%
Just push it over.
there wasn't much you could do,

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.620 align:middle line:90%
Just go relight it.
Despite the dedicated and hard work

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.489 align:middle line:90%
By these civil servants,
Calamities were unavoidable.

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:03.459 align:middle line:90%
Shipwrecks did occur and still
May occur due to extreme

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:08.599 align:middle line:90%
Weather and human error.
Lifelong Jamestown resident Jim West

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:14.790 align:middle line:90%
Recalls the shipwreck of the early 1930's.
A coal barge came over the

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:20.530 align:middle line:90%
East shoal here between Hull's Cove
And here, went ashore

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:24.569 align:middle line:90%
And we could get down to
The shoal so everybody hauled

00:04:24.569 --> 00:04:29.900 align:middle line:90%
Coal that winter.
It was the fall of that year, September.

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.740 align:middle line:90%
They didn't want to do
Anything you know until

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.300 align:middle line:90%
They sent out the word
That anybody wanted to

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.130 align:middle line:90%
Dig coal go down and do it.
So we did.

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:42.520 align:middle line:90%
It was good coal too.
I'll say that.

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:50.280 align:middle line:90%
It was red ash not the white ash,
So it helped out alot of people

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:58.070 align:middle line:90%
That year, I'll tell you
On the coal bill.

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:00.770 align:middle line:90%
As the fog begins to
Burn off, the Beavertail Lighthouse

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:04.350 align:middle line:90%
Beacon fades against the brightening
Morning sky.

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:08.440 align:middle line:90%
In addition to marking the coastline,
This lighthose also houses a museum

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.220 align:middle line:90%
That commerates the history
And service of other lighthouses

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:17.220 align:middle line:84%
In addition to the Beavertail Light.
